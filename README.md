Welcome to the user manual for Troy. It doesn't replace getting to know me but given my history at Outbrain and unique place in the TAM team it helps you understand my place in our organization as Technical Project Lead (TPL) and how I can help you succeed.

## Disclaimers
Since I wrote this document a lot of my biases are baked into it. It doesn't apply to any other Outbrainer. Call me on anything you see here that isn't true.

## Audience
This README is for anybody who works with me.

## Mission
Smooth the way for brilliant people to do brilliant things.

### Job and Roles
- I am the Technical Project Lead for the TAM team. As such I:
- Help TAMs create great tools and write some tools myself. 
- build internal tools, lead projects for the building of other tools, and keep aware of other TAM tool-building projects to help us avoid redundancy. 
- Help standardize our languages, toolsets and APIs with developers on the TAM team.
- Work with R&D and Prod teams to give feedback on APIs they build. 
- Serve as a technical mentor to the TAM team and train them on using our tools.

Our user base so far consists of TAMs, AMs, Business Operations and Product Managers. We want to expand that to BI, Finance, Product and R&D.

## History
I started at Outbrain in 2011 as an Account Manager (AM). That lasted a few months before it became clear that I was much better at helping other AMs than I was at being one. In response Outbrain created the Technical Account Manager (TAM) position. As a TAM I co-founded and lead the Sales Engineering and QA positions within the TAM group. In 2015 I grew into the TAM team lead position. From there I moved on to the Technical Project Lead I am today.

## Working with me
### Habits and Schedule
I work from home in Colorado. I start work around 9:30ET and end around 7:30-8PM ET, with an hour lunch. I'm most available on HipChat, then g-chat, then email. You can call me any time although if I don't recognize the number I don't answer. You can also text me. Right now I have no set schedule for coming into the NYC office. I can come on demand if there is enough need to justify the travel expense.

### Feedback
I serve you, not the other way around. That means I'm accountable to you. That accountability depends on your feedback.

The purpose of positive feedback isn't to make a person feel good but stimulate that person to do more of that good thing. The purpose of negative feedback is to do the opposite. If I do something that helps Outbrain tell me so I can do more of it. If I do something that doesn't help Outbrain tell me so I can adjust it.

I try to keep ego out of work, so you should be able to tell me anything. My hope is that I can do the same. I promise that any negative feedback I give is in the interest of helping you, the team, and Outbrain.

They key to valuable feedback is to keep it constant. If I'm a part of anybody's review I strive to make sure that no information I give is surprising.

### Features and bugs
The important thing is that we do what we say we're going to do. One of my big weaknesses is not following through administratively 100% of the time. Call me on that and I'll be sure to get you the paperwork. If you don't do what you say you'll do I promise tell you.

I like working alone but that's counterproductive. Call me on that.

I like a fight. Just like a forest needs fire to rejuvinate conflict is crucial for teams to remain fresh.

I won't do a task if I don't know why I'm doing it and I hope you feel the same way.

## Long term goals
- Create a regular development cycle that multiple teams follow
- Rise by lifting others
- Use my role to rigorously defend the lighthouse

## Short term goals
- Spread the usage of internally written APIs to the rest of the TAM team
- Gain dev time for TAM teams around the world
- Plan the TAM hackathon

## What I'm studying
Servant leadership
Radical candor

## Hobbies
Running, gardening, biking around town, travel, gym climbing

## 2018 Word of the year: Consistency
