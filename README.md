Welcome to the user manual for Troy. It doesn't replace getting to know me but should give a start understanding my role.

### Job and roles
I am the Technical Project Lead for the GTO team. In that role I:
- Help GTOs create great tools,
- Help the Efficiencies Team build tools,
- Keep abreast of other internal projects to help us avoid redundancy,
- Run some of our more complex automation jobs,
- Help standardize our languages, toolsets and APIs with developers on the GTO team,
- Work with R&D and Product teams to give feedback on APIs they build, and
- Serve as a technical mentor to the GTO team and train them on using our tools

Our users are Account Managers, Global Operations, Account Services, and Product Managers. We want to expand that to help BI, Finance, Product and R&D.

## History
I started at Outbrain in 2011 as an Account Manager (AM). I found I was much better at helping AMs find quick solutions to their problems. In response Outbrain created the Technical Account Manager (TAM) position. As a TAM I co-founded and lead the Sales Engineering and QA positions within the TAM group. In 2015 I grew into the TAM team lead position. From there I became Technical Project Lead and the TAMs became Global Technical Operations (GTO).

## Working with me
### Habits and schedule
I work from home in Colorado. I start work around 9:30 a.m. ET and end at 7:00 to 7:30 p.m. ET, with an hour lunch. I'm most available on Slack, then email, then g-chat. You can call me any time although I recommend Telegram or WhatsApp for calls; otherwise if I don't recognize the number I don't answer.

### Features and bugs
One of my big challenges is following through with administrative tasks. Call me on that and I'll be sure to get you the paperwork. 

## Long term goals
- Create a regular development cycle that multiple GTO teams follow.
- Use my role to defend the [Lighthouse](https://www.outbrain.com/blog/you-are-what-you-recommend-value-of-trust/).
- Organize a team to rewrite our automation scripts in python or node.

## Short term goals
- Spread the usage of internally written APIs to the GTO team members so they can build cool stuff with them.
- Gain dev time for GTOs around the world.
- Help make a new GTO logo.

## What I'm studying
Informally studying the positive role bacteria plays in soil health.

## Hobbies
Running, gardening, biking around town, travel, gym climbing
